# Crowdfunding_ETL

For this project work, my group decided to work on building the ETL pipeline individually and help each other when it comes to any questions any struggles, we may have. We individually found a way to extract and transform the data according to the rubric. After which we created a entity relationship diagram (ERD) for each of the transformed csv files. We gave each other support and a helping hand at each of the step and finished the project work in the given time.
